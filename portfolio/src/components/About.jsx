    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>Arvind</strong>, a passionate and curious web developer who loves turning ideas into real-world applications. I'm currently pursuing my MCA and constantly building up my skills in modern web technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy crafting clean, responsive, and interactive websites. Whether it's frontend design with React or building backend logic, I love learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring UI/UX trends, working on side projects, or diving into the world of AI and IoT. I'm always excited to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's build something awesome together!
